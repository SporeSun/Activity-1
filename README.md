## Description

The motivation for this project was refactoring the code for the Services Offered and benefits page for the Horiseon company. We were motivated to optimize and consolidate code to increase efficiency and improve future workflow on the project. We solved the issue of code redundancy and missing links within the page, and learned to collaboratively work together with peers to effectively problem solve along with understanding how to make efficient code.
